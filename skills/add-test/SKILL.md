# Add Test - tests automatisés + cahier de recette

## Communication
- Detect the user's language from the conversation (the user's own messages, anywhere in the session - not just this invocation: a bare slash command like `/bootstrap` carries no language signal by itself). If nothing in the conversation gives a signal, fall back to the OS locale (`node -e "console.log(Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().locale)"`) before defaulting to English. ALWAYS reply in that language for every user-facing message: questions, progress, confirmations, summaries, errors - including any example text quoted in this skill, which is illustrative and must be translated, never sent verbatim.
- Use plain, non-technical business language. Never expose internal script names (*.mjs) or jargon; describe actions in human terms.
- When generating user-facing content for the scaffolded project (UI labels, emails, copy), write it in the user's language too.
- Show progress as a short natural-language checklist (in-progress and done states).

Gives the project two things that answer the same question, "does it work, and will it still work after the next change?", for two audiences:

- **`docs/recette.md`, the cahier de recette**: one line per feature, readable by someone who has never opened the code. What the feature does, how it is checked, what is expected, who validates.
- **Automated tests** (vitest): one per tRPC procedure at least, each tagged with the line of the cahier it covers (`// recette: R-07`).

And it wires the guard that keeps both alive: a **pre-push hook** and a **GitHub Action** that run the tests and refuse to publish while a procedure has no test or a page is missing from the cahier. From then on, "add a feature" means "add its line and its test", and the project's `CLAUDE.md` says so.

What this skill does NOT do: browser journey tests (Playwright). Pages are covered by a manual scenario in the cahier, written for a human. Journey tests may come in a later version; the cahier is designed so they can slot in without changing anything.

---

## Step 0 - Preflight: is the project already equipped?

**First of all**, invoke `_check-deps tests`:

```bash
result=$(node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/check-deps.mjs" tests)
tests_ok=$(echo "$result" | node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(0,'utf8')).tests.ok)")
```

### If `tests_ok = true` -> maintenance mode

The project already has vitest, a cahier de recette and the checker. Do NOT reinstall anything. Show a menu:

> ## ✅ Les tests et le cahier de recette sont déjà en place
>
> Que veux-tu faire ?
>
> 1. **Compléter la recette et les tests** (après une nouvelle fonctionnalité, ou parce que la publication a été refusée)
> 2. **Lancer la recette** et me montrer le résultat
> 3. **Réinstaller le garde-fou** (hook avant publication, action GitHub) s'il a été supprimé
> 4. **Autre chose** - dis-moi

Wait for the answer.

| Choice | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Jump to **Step 5** (inventory), then Steps 6 to 8. Only ADD what is missing: never rewrite existing lines or tests. |
| 2 | Run `pnpm test` then `node scripts/check-recette.mjs` (in `WEB_DIR`), and explain the result in plain words: what is verified, what is missing, what it means for the next publication. Then stop. |
| 3 | Re-run Step 3 for `.hooks/pre-push` and `.github/workflows/tests.yml` only, then Step 9. Then stop. |
| 4 | Ask for details. Do not launch the full flow by default. |

### If `tests_ok = false` -> installation

Continue to Step 1.

---

## Step 1 - Detect the project structure

Invoke `_detect-project-root`. You get `PROJECT_NAME`, `WEB_DIR`, `IS_MONOREPO`, `IS_NEXTJS`. If `IS_NEXTJS=no`, stop: this skill is for a Next.js project (typically initialized by `/bootstrap`).

Everything below runs **inside `WEB_DIR`** (`.` for a single app, `apps/web` in a monorepo). The hook and the GitHub Action are the only files written at the repository root.

## Step 2 - Install vitest

```bash
cd <WEB_DIR>
pnpm add -D vitest
node -e "
const fs=require('fs');const p=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('package.json','utf8'));
p.scripts??={};
p.scripts.test??='vitest run';
p.scripts['test:watch']??='vitest';
p.scripts.recette??='node scripts/check-recette.mjs';
fs.writeFileSync('package.json',JSON.stringify(p,null,2)+'\n');"
```

Idempotent: existing scripts are kept.

## Step 3 - Copy the templates

From `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../templates/tests/`:

| Template | Destination | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `vitest.config.ts` | `<WEB_DIR>/vitest.config.ts` | Do not overwrite an existing one: merge the `test.env` and `setupFiles` entries instead. |
| `setup.ts` | `<WEB_DIR>/tests/setup.ts` | Placeholder env values, so server modules load without real services. |
| `caller.ts` | `<WEB_DIR>/tests/helpers/caller.ts` | The tRPC caller used by every test. It puts the project's `db` (from `~/server/db`) in the context, so a test's `vi.mock("~/server/db")` is what the procedures receive. **Project without a database** (no `src/server/db/index.ts`): remove the `db` import and the `db` property from the helper. |
| `healthcheck.test.ts` | `<WEB_DIR>/tests/healthcheck.test.ts` | **Only if** `src/server/api/routers/healthcheck.ts` exists (created by `/bootstrap`). Otherwise skip it, and R-01 in the cahier will be the first real feature instead. |
| `check-recette.mjs` | `<WEB_DIR>/scripts/check-recette.mjs` | The checker. Versioned in the project: it runs on every machine and in CI. |
| `pre-push` | `<repo root>/.hooks/pre-push` | Replace `{{WEB_DIR}}` with the detected value (`.` or `apps/web`). Then `git update-index --add --chmod=+x .hooks/pre-push` after staging, so the executable bit travels with the repository. |
| `tests.yml` | `<repo root>/.github/workflows/tests.yml` | Replace `{{WEB_DIR}}`. |
| `recette.md` | `<WEB_DIR>/docs/recette.md` | Written in **Step 6**, not copied as is: it is the template of the cahier. |

Read each template before copying: they carry the explanations the user will read later (in the files themselves), so keep them intact apart from the placeholders.

## Step 4 - First run

```bash
cd <WEB_DIR> && pnpm test
```

The healthcheck test must pass. If it fails **at import time** (a server module refuses to load), the cause is almost always a variable that `~/env` demands: add it to `tests/setup.ts` with a placeholder value of the right shape. Never put a real key there. If it fails because the project has no healthcheck router, delete `tests/healthcheck.test.ts` and continue: Step 7 writes the real tests.

Two import-time failures are already handled by the templates, so you recognize them rather than fix them: `Cannot find module '.../next/server' imported from next-auth/lib/env.js` (vitest cannot resolve next-auth's own imports in a pnpm layout: `vitest.config.ts` inlines `next-auth`), and `This module cannot be imported from a Client Component module` (the `server-only` marker: `tests/setup.ts` neutralizes it, and simulates `next/cache` for the same reason). If either still appears, the project's `vitest.config.ts` or `tests/setup.ts` was not replaced by the template: compare and merge.

## Step 5 - Inventory: what must be covered

```bash
cd <WEB_DIR> && node scripts/check-recette.mjs --inventaire
```

You get, as JSON: the routers with their procedures, the pages with their routes, the existing tests, and (if a cahier exists) what is still uncovered. Also read:

- `cahier-des-charges.md` at the project root, if `/spec` produced one: it holds the business rules the cahier must state (a rule the spec writes is a line of the recette).
- `CLAUDE.md`: the conventions and the stack, to describe features with the right words.

## Step 6 - Write the cahier de recette

Write `<WEB_DIR>/docs/recette.md` from the `recette.md` template: keep its header (it explains the columns to a human), keep the R-01 line only if the healthcheck test exists, and generate the lines:

- **One line per tRPC procedure** (`Vérifiée par: test`). Describe the feature in business terms, not the procedure name: "Envoi du formulaire de contact", not `contact.send`. Put the procedure name in the "Comment on vérifie" column, so the reader can find the test.
- **One line per page** (`Vérifiée par: manuel`), with a scenario a person can follow in a browser and an expected result they can observe. The route (`/contact`) MUST appear in the line: that is how the checker matches a page to the cahier.
- **One line per business rule** from the spec that is not obviously a procedure or a page (a pricing rule, a deadline, a quota). Mark it `test` if it lives in code you can call, `manuel` otherwise.

Identifiers `R-01`, `R-02`... in order, never reused. Write the lines in the user's language. Statut: `ok` for lines you will cover with a passing test in Step 7, `à faire` for manual scenarios nobody has run yet.

In maintenance mode (Step 0, choice 1): append the missing lines with the next free identifiers, do not renumber.

## Step 7 - Write the tests

One file per router: `<WEB_DIR>/tests/<router>.test.ts`. Rules:

- **Meaningful assertions.** Each test checks a real output or a real refusal. Never `expect(true).toBe(true)`, never a test that only checks "it did not throw".
- **The literal `<router>.<procedure>` call through the caller** (`await caller().contact.send({...})`): the checker recognizes coverage by that exact text.
- **Tag every test** with the cahier line: `// recette: R-07` above the `it`, or in the file header for a whole file (`// recette: R-07, R-08`).
- **Never a real database, never the network.** A procedure that reads or writes `ctx.db` gets a simulated module:
  ```ts
  vi.mock("~/server/db", () => ({
    db: { query: { posts: { findMany: async () => [{ id: 1, title: "Bonjour" }] } } },
  }));
  ```
  Shape the fake after what the procedure actually calls (read the router first). For Drizzle query builders (`db.select().from()...`), return a chainable fake whose terminal call resolves to the fixture. Same for an email module (`~/lib/mail`, `~/server/mail`), a payment client, a storage client: simulate the module the router imports, then assert on what it received.
- **`vi.mock` is hoisted.** vitest moves every `vi.mock(...)` to the top of the file, before the `const` declarations: a factory that references a top-level variable throws `Cannot access 'x' before initialization`. Any fake the test needs to inspect or mutate later (a `vi.fn()` you assert on, an env object you toggle) MUST be created in `vi.hoisted`:
  ```ts
  const { sendMail, envSimule } = vi.hoisted(() => ({
    sendMail: vi.fn<(envoi: { to: { email: string }[]; subject: string }) => Promise<void>>(async () => undefined),
    envSimule: { BREVO_API_KEY: "cle-de-test" as string | undefined },
  }));
  vi.mock("~/lib/mail", () => ({ sendMail }));
  vi.mock("~/env", () => ({ env: envSimule }));
  ```
  Give `vi.fn` its signature (`vi.fn<(arg: T) => R>()`): without it, `mock.calls[0][0]` is typed as never and `pnpm tsc --noEmit` fails on the test.
- **Rate-limited procedures** (`rateLimitedProcedure`, keyed by IP): give each test its own `x-forwarded-for` header through the caller, or the fifth call of the file trips the limit meant for the sixth.
- **Patterns to cover, per procedure:**
  - a public query: the happy path, with the exact shape of the result;
  - a protected procedure called anonymously: `await expect(caller().x.y()).rejects.toMatchObject({ code: "UNAUTHORIZED" })`;
  - an input validated by zod: one invalid input rejected with `BAD_REQUEST`, one valid input accepted;
  - a mutation: the fake records what was written, and the test checks it (a `vi.fn()` on `insert`/`update`).
- **A large project** (more than 30 procedures): write and run router by router, so a failing fake is found while it is still small.

## Step 8 - Green, then complete

```bash
cd <WEB_DIR> && pnpm test && node scripts/check-recette.mjs
```

Both must be clean. The checker lists what is still missing, in plain language: a line marked `test` without a tagged test, a procedure no test exercises, a page absent from the cahier. Fix, re-run. Then:

```bash
pnpm tsc --noEmit && pnpm lint
```

Test files are TypeScript like the rest of the project: they go through the same checks.

## Step 9 - The hook on this machine

The repository's `.hooks/pre-push` only runs if the machine's global git hooks hand over to it (Hypervibe sets `core.hooksPath` globally for the secret scan, which makes `.git/hooks` inert). Make sure the chain exists:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/ensure-hooks-chain.mjs"
```

| Output | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `OK` / `INSTALLED` | The global chain hook is in place. Every repository with a `.hooks/pre-push` is now guarded on this machine. |
| `LOCAL` | No global hooks path (the secret scan was never installed): the chain was written into this repository's `.git/hooks/pre-push` instead. Suggest `/start` later, which installs the global setup. |
| `FOREIGN` | A `pre-push` that is not Hypervibe's already exists. Do not overwrite it. Tell the user where it is (`~/.git-hooks/pre-push`) and what to add to it (the block that runs `.hooks/pre-push`). |

Other people who clone the project get the same guard as soon as they have run `/start` (which installs the chain) - and the GitHub Action covers the case where they have not.

## Step 10 - Update CLAUDE.md

Invoke `_update-claude-md` with:
- `commands`:
  - `- \`pnpm test\` - lance les tests (vitest)`
  - `- \`pnpm recette\` - vérifie que chaque fonctionnalité a sa vérification dans \`docs/recette.md\``
- `conventions`:
  - `- **Tests et recette** : \`docs/recette.md\` est le cahier de recette, une ligne par fonctionnalité (identifiant \`R-xx\`). Toute fonctionnalité nouvelle ou modifiée ajoute ou relit sa ligne ET son test (\`tests/<routeur>.test.ts\`, tagué \`// recette: R-xx\`, appelant \`<routeur>.<procédure>\` via \`tests/helpers/caller.ts\`, base simulée par \`vi.mock("~/server/db")\`, jamais de vraie base). Toute nouvelle page ajoute sa ligne (scénario manuel, avec sa route). \`pnpm test\` avant tout commit : le hook pre-push et l'action GitHub refusent de publier tant qu'une procédure n'a pas de test ou qu'une page manque au cahier. Ne jamais contourner avec \`--no-verify\` : compléter la recette à la place.`

Translate these lines into the user's language if the project's CLAUDE.md is not in French.

## Step 11 - Commit (no push)

Stage nominatively (the guardrail refuses `git add -A`), then commit:

```bash
git add docs/recette.md tests scripts/check-recette.mjs vitest.config.ts package.json pnpm-lock.yaml CLAUDE.md .hooks/pre-push .github/workflows/tests.yml
git update-index --chmod=+x .hooks/pre-push
git commit -m "feat(tests): cahier de recette et tests automatisés"
```

(Adapt the paths with `<WEB_DIR>/` in a monorepo.) Do NOT push: the user publishes when they want to, and that push will be the first one the hook checks.

## Step 12 - Summary

Tell the user, in plain words:

- What now exists: the cahier (`docs/recette.md`, N lines, so many by test, so many manual), the tests (N files, all green), the guard (before every publication on this machine, and on GitHub for everyone).
- **How it works from now on**: adding a feature adds its line and its test; that is written in `CLAUDE.md`, so Claude Code does it on its own. If a publication is refused, the message says exactly what is missing, and "complète la recette et les tests manquants" fixes it.
- **What the cahier is for**: it is the document to hand to whoever validates the application (a manager, a client, an IT department). The manual lines are a checklist for them; the "Procès-verbal" table at the bottom is where they sign off.
- What is not covered yet: browser journeys (a page is checked by a person following the scenario), and anything the fakes do not reproduce (a real database constraint, a third-party service). Say it plainly: a green suite means "the logic we wrote behaves as written", not "nothing can go wrong".
