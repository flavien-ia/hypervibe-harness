# /security

Audits the security of your app and automatically fixes common flaws. Hypervibe covers 12 risk categories (exposed secrets, poorly protected routes, vulnerable dependencies, forged webhooks, etc.) with a plain-language explanation for each finding.

## When to use it

- **Before going to production** on a public domain
- After adding a critical feature (payments, auth, file uploads)
- Periodically (every 2-3 months) to stay up to date

## How it works

1. **Disclaimer displayed at the start**: Hypervibe reminds you that this is an audit of common flaws. For apps that handle very sensitive data (health, banking, critical data), a professional security audit is still necessary.

2. **Audit across 12 categories**:
  - **Secrets and env variables**: search for hardcoded keys/tokens in the code, check the `.gitignore`, verify that secrets are not committed in the Git history
  - **Authentication and access control**: verify that admin/protected pages are not accessible without login, that access rules are enforced server-side, and that each user can only reach their own data (not someone else's by changing an id in the request)
  - **Input validation**: verify that user data is validated server-side (zod, etc.), including file uploads (type and size)
  - **SQL injection and database queries**: verify that queries are parameterized (no string concatenation)
  - **Security headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.
  - **CORS**: cross-origin request configuration
  - **Vulnerable dependencies**: `npm audit` on production dependencies, including the framework itself
  - **Rate limiting and abuse protection**: protection against brute force and abuse (e.g. on login)
  - **Data exposure**: verify that API responses and logs do not leak sensitive data
  - **Next.js configuration**: safe framework settings (no secrets in client bundles, etc.)
  - **Webhooks**: verify that notifications sent by third-party services (e.g. Stripe after a payment) are authenticated, so nobody can forge a fake "payment received"
  - **Server-side requests (SSRF)**: verify that your server cannot be tricked into calling internal addresses through a user-provided URL

3. **Educational report**: each finding is classified ✅ OK / ⚠️ To improve / 🔴 Critical. For each problem:
  - **Plain-language explanation** ("XSS = an attack where someone injects malicious code into a page that other people visit")
  - **Concrete consequence** ("if someone exploits this flaw, they can steal your visitors' cookies")
  - **Proposed fix** with the **why** of the fix, not just the code

4. **Automatic fixes**: Hypervibe fixes what can be fixed safely (adding headers, fixing the code, updating vulnerable dependencies). For the rest, it shows you the diff and you approve it.

## What it creates for you

- A **complete security report** with verdicts and explanations
- **Fixes applied** automatically (with your approval for behavior changes)
- A potential update to `CLAUDE.md` with the project's security conventions

## Prerequisites

- No particular prerequisite, `/security` can run on any project in the plugin

## Tips

{{callout:warning|Does not replace a professional audit for sensitive cases}}
If your app handles medical, financial, or very personal data (e.g. identity, biometrics), a professional audit is still essential. `/security` covers 95% of common mistakes but does not replace an expert who digs into the business cases specific to your field.

{{callout:tip|Run it regularly}}
Vulnerabilities evolve quickly (new flaws in npm packages every week). Running `/security` every 2-3 months is good hygiene. Hypervibe proposes automatic updates for critical and high-severity flaws.

{{callout:info|Not alarmist}}
Hypervibe is designed to **explain**, not to scare you. You see each problem with its concrete consequence, but also the real severity (a showcase site with no form does not have the same risks as a site with auth + payments). You prioritize what really matters.
