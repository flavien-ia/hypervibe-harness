# Add Email - Resend or Brevo

Adds transactional email support to the current project. **Supports two providers** (Resend and Brevo) with a single unified flow: the skill decides which one to install based on the user's existing API keys, without asking when the choice is unambiguous.

The deterministic core (SDK install, `mail.ts` + contact tRPC router scaffolding, `root.ts` patching, env var push) is handled by `scripts/setup-email.mjs --provider <resend|brevo>`. This SKILL takes care of: provider selection, prereqs validation, re-config detection, post-install steps (domain config, contact page, RGPD update), and the final summary.

## Communication
- Detect the user's language from their messages and ALWAYS reply in that language (default: English). This applies to every user-facing message: questions, progress, confirmations, summaries, errors.
- Use plain, non-technical business language. Never expose internal script names (*.mjs) or jargon; describe actions in human terms.
- When generating user-facing content for the scaffolded project (UI labels, emails, copy), write it in the user's language too.
- Show progress as a short natural-language checklist (in-progress and done states).

---

## Preflight - vault unlocked

This skill reads the email key (Resend/Brevo) from the vault, so first make sure it is unlocked (follow **`_ensure-vault`**): `node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/vault/vault.mjs" status` then if `locked`/`expired`, run `launch.mjs unlock` (window, once a day); if the vault does not exist yet, delegate to `_add-keyring`.

---

## Step 0 - Preflight: is a provider already configured in THIS project?

**First of all**, invoke `_check-deps email` to detect the project state:

```bash
result=$(node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/check-deps.mjs" email)
email_ok=$(echo "$result" | node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(0,'utf8')).email.ok)")
email_provider=$(echo "$result" | node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(0,'utf8')).email.provider || 'none')")
```

### If `email_ok = true` then silent re-configuration mode (Resend or Brevo)

The project already has a provider installed (`$email_provider` is in {`resend`, `brevo`}). **Stay on that provider** (no question, no automatic switch). Do NOT run `setup-email.mjs` (the script refuses to overwrite existing `mail.ts` + `contact.ts`).

Show a menu tailored to the provider:

> ## 📬 ${email_provider === "resend" ? "Resend" : "Brevo"} is already set up on your project
>
> What do you want to do?
>
> 1. **Change the sending address** (e.g. switch to `contact@yourdomain.com`)
> 2. **Change the address where you receive messages** from the contact form
> 3. **Create the `/contact` page** if it does not exist yet
> 4. **Start over from scratch** (if the config is broken - first delete the current keys from `.env` AND the files `src/server/mail.ts` + `src/server/api/routers/contact.ts`)
> 5. **Something else** - tell me what you want

Wait for the answer.

**Depending on the answer**:

| Choice | Resend action | Brevo action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (change sender) | Jump to **Step 6** (domain config via `_dns-resend`). | Ask for the new `BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL`. If custom domain, invoke `_dns-brevo`. Then `_push-env-vars BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL=<email>` (and `BREVO_SENDER_NAME` if changed). Reminder: the sender must be verified in the Brevo dashboard (Settings then Senders & IPs). |
| 2 (change recipient) | Invoke `_create-contact-page` in "update recipient only" mode - run just its Step 2 (`CONTACT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL`) and skip creation if it already exists. |
| 3 (create contact page) | Invoke `_create-contact-page` directly. |
| 4 (start over) | For Resend: delete `RESEND_API_KEY` from `.env` + prompt to revoke it in the Resend dashboard. For Brevo: delete `BREVO_API_KEY` from `.env`. In both cases: delete `src/server/mail.ts` + `src/server/api/routers/contact.ts`. Then go back to the normal **Step 1**. |
| 5 (other) | Ask for clarification. Do not run the install flow by default. |

**At the end**, jump straight to **Step 9** (summary).

### If `email_ok = false` then fresh install, continue to Step 1

---

## Step 1 - Choose the provider (automatic, no question)

Read the user-scope API keys:

```bash
HAS_RESEND_KEY=$(node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/_read-user-env.mjs" RESEND_API_KEY 2>/dev/null | grep -c . || echo 0)
HAS_BREVO_KEY=$(node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/_read-user-env.mjs" BREVO_API_KEY 2>/dev/null | grep -c . || echo 0)
```

Apply the **decision rule** (NO question to the user):

| Available user keys | Chosen provider | Flag in the final summary? |
|---|---|---|
| None | **Resend** | ✅ "I installed Resend by default. Create an API key and I will store it in your vault (item `RESEND`) to finish." |
| Resend only | **Resend** | no (silent) |
| Brevo only | **Brevo** | no (silent) |
| Both | **Brevo** | ✅ "You have both keys. I went with Brevo. To switch back to Resend later: delete your Brevo config and re-run `/add-email`." |

Store `CHOSEN_PROVIDER` (in {resend, brevo}) and `CHOICE_NOTE` (string or empty) for the following Steps.

Show a short message to the user, for example:

> ↳ Provider detected: **Brevo** (Brevo key detected) ✅

Or for the Resend default with no key:

> ↳ No email key detected - I am installing **Resend by default**. You will finish with the key afterwards. ✅

---

## Step 2 - Detect project + validate prereqs

Invoke `_detect-project-root` to get `PROJECT_NAME`, `WEB_DIR`, `IS_NEXTJS`. Abort if `IS_NEXTJS=no`.

### If `CHOSEN_PROVIDER = resend`

**No more Resend CLI.** Check that the Resend key is in the vault (the app sends via the SDK + `RESEND_API_KEY`, not via the CLI):

```bash
VAULT="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/vault/vault.mjs"
node "$VAULT" get RESEND api_key >/dev/null 2>&1; RC=$?
```
- `RC=0` then key present, move on to Step 3.
- `RC=2/3` (vault locked/expired) then warn the user, `node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/vault/launch.mjs" unlock` (blocking), retry.
- `RC=4` (key missing) then have it created + stored in the vault:
  > To send emails, I need a Resend key (just once - I store it in your vault).
  > 1. Go to **https://resend.com/api-keys** then **Create API Key** then **Full Access** and copy it.
  > 2. A window will open: paste it in (masked input).
  ```bash
  node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/vault/launch.mjs" add --name RESEND --service Resend --fields "api_key:secret"
  ```
  Then retry the `get`.

⚠️ The script `setup-email.mjs --provider resend` then reads `RESEND.api_key` from the vault (non-interactive), which is why the key must be there BEFORE calling it.

### If `CHOSEN_PROVIDER = brevo`

Check that the Brevo key is in the vault (the app sends via the SDK + `BREVO_API_KEY`):

```bash
VAULT="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/vault/vault.mjs"
node "$VAULT" get BREVO api_key >/dev/null 2>&1; RC=$?
```
- `RC=0` then key present, move on to Step 3.
- `RC=2/3` (vault locked/expired) then warn the user, `node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/vault/launch.mjs" unlock` (blocking), retry.
- `RC=4` (key missing) then have it created + stored in the vault:
  > To use Brevo, I need an API key (just once - I store it in your vault).
  > 1. Go to **https://app.brevo.com/settings/keys/api** then **Generate a new API key** (name `claude-code`) and copy it (`xkeysib-...`).
  > 2. A window will open: paste it in (masked input).
  ```bash
  node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/vault/launch.mjs" add --name BREVO --service Brevo --fields "api_key:secret"
  ```
  Then retry the `get`.

⚠️ The script `setup-email.mjs --provider brevo` then reads `BREVO.api_key` from the vault (non-interactive), so the key must be there BEFORE calling it.

### Decide on the sender (Brevo only)

For Brevo, the script needs `--brevo-sender <email>`. By default, **ask the user** for their desired sending email, OR take the email from the user's Resend / Brevo account (found in their user doc or their `.env`). For `--brevo-sender-name`, default = `<PROJECT_NAME>`.

For Resend, no need - by default the script writes `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev` (test sender) and we ask at Step 6 whether the user wants a custom domain.

---

## Step 3 - Run setup-email.mjs

Run the script with the chosen `--provider`:

### Resend
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/setup-email.mjs" \
  --provider resend \
  --name "<PROJECT_NAME>" \
  --web-dir "<WEB_DIR>"
```

### Brevo
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/setup-email.mjs" \
  --provider brevo \
  --name "<PROJECT_NAME>" \
  --brevo-sender "<sender-email>" \
  --brevo-sender-name "<PROJECT_NAME>" \
  --web-dir "<WEB_DIR>"
```

The script chains 7 sub-steps: preflight, get/read API key, install SDK, write `mail.ts`, write contact tRPC router, register `contactRouter` in `root.ts`, push env vars.

### During execution

The script prints live:
- `▸ <step>` when it starts each sub-step
- `✅ <result>` at the end of each one
- `⚠️ <warning>` for non-blocking warnings (rateLimitedProcedure missing, etc.)
- At the end, a structured **handoff banner**
- On the last line on success, a parseable JSON object:
  - Resend: `{"success":true,"provider":"resend","envVars":["RESEND_API_KEY","RESEND_FROM_EMAIL"]}`
  - Brevo: `{"success":true,"provider":"brevo","envVars":["BREVO_API_KEY","BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL","BREVO_SENDER_NAME"]}`

Let the output through live (no `> /tmp/...`, no capture).

### On failure

1. **Read the detailed error**: just above the handoff banner.
2. **Identify the failed step** in the banner (`❌ Failed at: <step>`). The name maps 1:1 to a function in the script - open `setup-email.mjs` and read the function to understand.
3. **Diagnose**:
   - `preflight` then usually an already existing file (`mail.ts` or `contact.ts`) or no Next.js / no tRPC. Handle specifically.
   - `getApiKey` Resend/Brevo then the key is not in the vault (or the vault is locked). Store the key: `node scripts/vault/launch.mjs add --name RESEND --service Resend --fields "api_key:secret"` (or `--name BREVO --service Brevo`), after a `launch.mjs unlock` if needed. Then re-run.
   - `installSdk` then a pnpm error (network, registry). Retry by hand: `cd <WEB_DIR> && pnpm add <pkg>`.
   - `writeMailTs` / `writeContactRouter` then FS permission (rare).
   - `registerRouter` then T3 may have reorganized `root.ts`. Patch manually: add `import { contactRouter } from "~/server/api/routers/contact";` + `contact: contactRouter,` in the `createTRPCRouter({...})`.
   - `pushEnvVars` then all the code is in place, only the env vars did not land. Invoke `_push-env-vars` manually.
4. **Continue** the remaining steps manually, drawing on the script's functions.

---

## Step 4 - Update CLAUDE.md

Invoke `_update-claude-md` with **the sections tailored to the chosen provider**.

### If Resend

- `stack`: `- **Email**: Resend (transactional emails via \`sendMail()\` in \`<WEB_DIR>/src/server/mail.ts\`)`
- `env-vars`:
  - `- \`RESEND_API_KEY\` - Resend API key`
  - `- \`RESEND_FROM_EMAIL\` - default sender email`
  - `- \`CONTACT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL\` - contact form recipient (optional, falls back to \`RESEND_FROM_EMAIL\`)`
- `conventions`:
  - `- Email: always use \`escapeHtml()\` from \`~/server/mail\` on user data before injecting it into an email's HTML.`

### If Brevo

- `stack`: `- **Email**: Brevo SDK v5 (\`BrevoClient\`) - transactional emails via \`sendMail()\` in \`<WEB_DIR>/src/server/mail.ts\``
- `env-vars`:
  - `- \`BREVO_API_KEY\` - Brevo transactional API key`
  - `- \`BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL\` - default sender email`
  - `- \`BREVO_SENDER_NAME\` - default sender name`
  - `- \`CONTACT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL\` - contact form recipient (optional, falls back to \`BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL\`)`
- `conventions`:
  - `- Email: always pipe user data through \`escapeForBrevo()\` (from \`~/server/mail\`) before inserting into \`htmlContent\`. NEVER let a raw \`{{\` (user input, stack trace, JSON) through into \`htmlContent\` or \`textContent\` - Brevo does a silent Mustache-style templating pass that drops the email with no visible error.`

**Also add a dedicated section** about the Brevo quirk (under the heading `## Email - Brevo quirk`):

```markdown
## Email - Brevo quirk

Brevo runs implicit Mustache-style templating on \`htmlContent\` and \`textContent\` at send time. Any \`{{\` in the body (stack traces, malformed JSON, user input) raises an async parse failure - the SDK call already returned 201 by then, so the \`try/catch\` sees nothing and the email is silently dropped.

**Rules:**
- Always pipe user-provided or error-derived strings through \`escapeForBrevo()\` before inserting into \`htmlContent\`.
- For \`textContent\`, at minimum neutralize \`{{\` with \`.replace(/\{\{/g, "{ {")\`.
- Treat \`await sendMail(...)\` as "best effort, not confirmed sent" - for critical flows (password resets, payments), add a Brevo webhook to catch async failures.
```

---

## Step 5 - RGPD: privacy policy

Add the provider to the project's RGPD subprocessor registry:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/update-privacy-policy.mjs" --add <provider>
```

(where `<provider>` = `resend` or `brevo` depending on `CHOSEN_PROVIDER`). The helper is idempotent. If the page `politique-de-confidentialite/page.tsx` exists, it updates automatically.

Note: Brevo (Sendinblue SAS) is EU-resident - no outside-EU transfer mechanism to declare. Resend is in the US - a transfer mechanism (standard contractual clauses) is already documented in the template.

---

## Step 6 - Custom sender / domain (optional, last step before the contact page)

At this point, the scaffolding is in place. What remains is to decide on the final sender.

### If Resend (current sender = `onboarding@resend.dev`, test sender)

Show:

> ## ✅ The setup is in place - last step: choose the sending email
>
> For now I set the Resend test address (`onboarding@resend.dev`). It works but can only send to your own email (your Resend account's). Great for testing, not for writing to users.
>
> If you want to send from your own address (e.g. `contact@mydomain.com`), I can configure your domain now in Resend (add DNS records + verification, 1-2 min).
>
> Three options:
>
> 1. **Leave the test address for now**
> 2. **Use my domain** - tell me the email
> 3. **I already have a Resend domain configured** - tell me the email to use

#### Case 1 - Leave the default then skip to Step 7.

#### Case 2 - Custom email, domain not yet in Resend

Extract the domain. Check it is not already verified (Resend API, key from the vault):

```bash
RTOK=$(node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/vault/vault.mjs" get RESEND api_key)
curl -s "https://api.resend.com/domains" -H "Authorization: Bearer $RTOK"
```

If the domain is there with `status == "verified"` then go to Case 3. Otherwise check Cloudflare:

```bash
result=$(node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/check-deps.mjs" cloudflare)
cf_ok=$(echo "$result" | node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(0,'utf8')).cloudflare.ok)")
```

If `cf_ok = true`, check that the domain is in a CF zone:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones?name=<domain>" \
  | node -e "const d = JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(0, 'utf8')); console.log(d.result?.[0]?.id ? 'EXISTS' : 'NOT_FOUND');"
```

- `EXISTS` then invoke `_dns-resend` with the domain. That skill creates the domain in Resend, adds SPF/DKIM/MX via the CF API, polls the verification, updates `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`.
- `NOT_FOUND` then propose `/add-domain` (which will switch DNS to CF then chain Resend).

If `cf_ok = false` then propose `/start` to configure Cloudflare, or to leave the default.

#### Case 3 - Custom email, domain already verified

Invoke `_push-env-vars` with `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=<email>`.

### If Brevo (sender already defined at Step 2)

The Brevo sender was passed to the script at Step 3 and is already in place. If the user wants to **change** it now:

Ask which sender they want. If custom domain, invoke `_dns-brevo` with the domain to configure it in Brevo (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) + via the Cloudflare API. Then `_push-env-vars BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL=<new>`.

⚠️ **Manual action Brevo**: the sender must be **verified** in the Brevo dashboard (Settings then Senders & IPs). Remind them of this.

---

## Step 7 - Propose the contact page

The tRPC back-end is created by the script (the `contact.send` procedure with honeypot + provider-specific escape + rate limiting). What is missing is the front-end page.

Propose to the user:

> ## 📨 And a contact page that works right away?
>
> I set up the engine that sends emails on the server side. If you want, I can create **a working `/contact` page** now - a Name / Email / Message form, a Send button, and all the anti-spam guards.
>
> It takes 30 seconds.

### If accepted

Invoke `_create-contact-page`. That skill automatically detects the provider via `_check-deps email` and adapts what it creates.

### If declined

Skip - mention at Step 9 that they can ask *"create me a contact page"* later.

---

## Step 8 - (empty, placeholder)

---

## Step 9 - Final summary

Adapt depending on the provider and the situation:

### Case A - Resend installed with `onboarding@resend.dev`

> ✅ Resend is configured. Your emails will go out from `onboarding@resend.dev` - a test sender that can only write to your own email for now. Enough for testing. When you want to send to your users, tell me *"configure my domain for email sending"*.

### Case B - Resend installed with verified custom sender

> ✅ Resend is configured. Your emails will go out from `<email>`. You can write to anyone now.

### Case C - Brevo installed

> ✅ Brevo is configured (`sendMail()` + `escapeForBrevo()` in `<WEB_DIR>/src/server/mail.ts`).
>
> ⚠️ **Manual action required**: check that `<sender-email>` is a verified sender in Brevo (Settings then Senders & IPs). Without it, emails fail silently on the Brevo side.
>
> A note on the Brevo templating quirk has been added to CLAUDE.md (`## Email - Brevo quirk`) so future Claude sessions do not reintroduce the silent-send bug.

### In all cases, add:

- *The sending engine is ready (the `contact.send` tRPC procedure, with honeypot + escape + rate limiting)*
- If the contact page was created: *Your `/contact` page is ready, you can test it right away*
- Otherwise: *When you want a contact page, tell me "create me a contact page"*
- Provider free plan:
  - Resend: 3,000 emails/month, 100/day
  - Brevo: 300 emails/day (≈ 9,000/month)
- Dashboard:
  - Resend: https://resend.com
  - Brevo: https://app.brevo.com

### If `CHOICE_NOTE` is non-empty (cf. Step 1)

**Always add** the choice note at the start or the end of the summary. Examples:

- "no key" case then "Note: you had no email key. I installed **Resend** by default. Create a key at https://resend.com/api-keys and I will store it in your vault (item `RESEND`)."
- "both keys" case then "Note: you had **both keys** (Resend AND Brevo) in your user env vars. I went with **Brevo** by default. If you prefer Resend for this project, delete the config (`.env` + `mail.ts` + `contact.ts`) and re-run `/add-email`."

If any warnings were raised by the script (e.g. `rateLimitedProcedure` missing), mention them here as well.
