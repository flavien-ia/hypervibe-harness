# /bootstrap

Creates a complete web project from your description in a few sentences. Code, hosting, database, payments: everything is set up to have an app online in 15 to 25 minutes.

## When to use it

To start a new project. It is the most powerful command in the plugin: you describe what you want in a few sentences, and it builds the whole app.

## How it works

The bootstrap unfolds in **8 steps**, with two fully autonomous phases and a discussion phase in the middle:

**Phase 1: Automatic construction** (~5 minutes, no intervention)
1. You give the **project name** and a **short description**.
2. Hypervibe builds the skeleton of the app: code structure, GitHub repo, Vercel configuration, first page online, security checks. You watch the steps scroll by; at the end, your site already responds with a minimal page and the automatic deployment is validated.

**Phase 2: Spec** (variable duration, discussion)
3. Hypervibe asks you **how you want to define the project**:
  - **Option A**: build a spec together, question by question (recommended for a first project)
  - **Option B**: you already have a `.md` file, it reads it
  - **Option C**: no spec, just the initial description (the app will be simpler, you will enrich it with vibe coding)
4. Hypervibe presents you a **summary** of the inferred features (database, authentication, emails, payments, etc.) and waits for your validation. You can change the list as much as you want before validating.

**Phase 3: Building the app** (~10-15 minutes, no intervention)
5. **Module configuration** (one by one): database, authentication, emails, payments, multilingual, storage... according to your validation.
6. **Building the application**: pages, forms, admin area if needed, design, responsive layout.
7. **Legal pages** automatically created (legal notice, GDPR-compliant privacy policy).
8. **Security audit + final push + summary**: dependency check, deployment, and a complete summary of what was done and what may remain to be done on your side (create an account on a given service, configure a domain, etc.).

At the end, you have an online, functional site, with all the technical building blocks in place.

## What it creates for you

- A complete **Next.js 15** project (structure, dependencies, configuration)
- A **private GitHub repo** with all the code versioned
- A **Vercel project** with automatic deployment (each change deploys on its own)
- An **online URL** where your app is accessible immediately
- According to what you chose: database, authentication, emails, payments, multilingual, storage, analytics
- The **legal pages** (legal notice + GDPR-friendly privacy policy)
- A `CLAUDE.md` file that serves as memory for Claude on this project
- All of it **hosted in Europe** (Frankfurt) for latency and GDPR compliance

## Prerequisites

- `/start` must have been run once on your machine (tools installed + accounts connected)
- If you plan to add a database, a Neon API key must be in your vault (Hypervibe guides you to add it if needed)

## Tips

{{callout:tip|If the session is interrupted}}
The bootstrap is long. If the Claude conversation is interrupted along the way (context limit, error, accidental close), no panic: just say **"continue"** in the same chat. Hypervibe re-reads its own thread and resumes where it left off. No work is lost.

{{callout:info|You do not write a single line of code}}
You describe your project in natural language, you validate the choices proposed to you. Everything else, code, configuration, deployment, security, is fully automated. You have **nothing** to type in a terminal.
{{/callout}}

{{callout:warning|Name choice = final}}
The project name you give at Step 1 becomes the name of the GitHub repo and the Vercel project. These two names are hard to change afterward. Choose well (in kebab-case, for example: `my-great-app`).
