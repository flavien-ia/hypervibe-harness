# /new-email-address

Creates a **new receiving address** on a domain that is already connected (for example `support@mysite.com` forwarded to your Gmail).

## When to use it

- You have connected your domain via `/add-domain` and you want to create several addresses (`contact@`, `support@`, `hello@`, `info@`…)
- You want to receive emails on your domain without creating a real mailbox
- You want to create a **catch-all** (`*@mysite.com` that forwards everything to a single mailbox)

## How it works

1. **Cloudflare check**: Hypervibe checks that your Cloudflare token is valid. Otherwise, it sends you to `/start`.

2. **Domain identification**: Hypervibe looks in your project's `CLAUDE.md` to retrieve the already connected domain. If it cannot find it, it asks you.

3. **Email Routing activation**: Hypervibe quietly enables Email Routing on your Cloudflare zone (idempotent, no problem if it is already active). On the first pass, Cloudflare automatically adds the necessary MX + SPF records.

4. **Alias prefix**: Hypervibe asks you for the prefix you want (the part before the `@`), for example `support`, `hello`, `info`, `contact`, `hi`, `me`. You can also answer `*` or "all" to create a catch-all.

5. **Destination**:
  - If Hypervibe was already called from `/add-domain` and you provided a destination address, it is reused.
  - Otherwise, Hypervibe lists your already verified destinations (if there are any) and offers to reuse them, or to add a new one.
  - If it is a new destination, Cloudflare sends it a verification email, you must click the link in your mailbox, then tell Hypervibe "done".

6. **Rule creation**: Hypervibe creates the forwarding rule in Cloudflare. From now on, emails received at `<prefix>@<domain>` are forwarded instantly to your target mailbox.

7. **Test**: Hypervibe offers to test by sending an email to the new address from another mailbox. If there are several addresses to create, Hypervibe loops back to save time.

## What it creates for you

- A **new forwarding rule** in Cloudflare Email Routing
- If it is the first time on this domain: **Email Routing enabled** + MX/SPF records added automatically
- If it is a new destination: an email to verify in your mailbox

## Prerequisites

- Your domain must already be managed by Cloudflare (typically after `/add-domain`)
- Cloudflare connected to your computer (`/start` takes care of that)

## Tips

{{callout:tip|Catch-all = handy so you never miss anything}}
If you want to **receive everything** on your domain (`anything@mysite.com` → your mailbox), answer `*` when Hypervibe asks you for the prefix. This is handy if you give your address in different forms to different services (`amazon@mysite.com` for Amazon, `netflix@mysite.com` for Netflix, etc.). You instantly know who shared your email if you receive spam.

{{callout:info|You reply from your usual mailbox}}
Email Routing only **receives** emails. To **send** from your domain (`contact@mysite.com`), you need to set up a service like Resend (`/add-email`) or add your domain in Gmail/Outlook as a sending alias.

{{callout:warning|Check your spam on the first add}}
The first time you use a destination, Cloudflare sends a verification email, it sometimes lands in your mailbox's spam folder. Remember to check before telling Hypervibe "done", otherwise the rule will not work.
