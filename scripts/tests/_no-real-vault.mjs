// _no-real-vault.mjs - Loaded into every Node process of a recette by run-all.mjs (NODE_OPTIONS
// --import): the vault's own tool (`bw`) never runs during a recette. A launch is refused, without
// reaching anything, and written down; run-all.mjs then fails the suite that did it, naming it.
//
// Why: a recette never opens the vault (the promise of SECURITY.md and of the Team READMEs). Two
// recettes did, unseen, until 04/10/2026: they ran a script with the machine's own home folder, and
// that script read a key in the vault with the session of the day. It showed when the vault's tool
// started keeping its sign-in in one folder on Windows (scripts/vault/bw-home.mjs): the first run of
// the recettes took over the machine's sign-in. A recette that needs the vault plays a fake one.
